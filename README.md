<!-- 
Currently a DevOps Developer at IBM, in the Cloud team ‚òÅÔ∏è.

Some of the technologies I'm working wiht now include: Terraform, Kubernetes & OpenShift, Chef & Instana

Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python, JavaScript and Java. Others I have worked with in the past are Docker, MongoDB (NoSQL), Neo4J (graph), and PostreSQL (relational).

I have had exposure to ReactJS, AWS and GraphQL and am currently taking courses to learn them even better.

Ideally, I would love to work as a back-end developer; however, I am definitely open to chatting about other types of opportunities.
