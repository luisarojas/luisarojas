# Hello, I'm Luisa!

I have just completed my **MSc in Computer Science** and am looking for my next adventure as a **Software Developer**.

I have experience with Python, Java, JavaScript and C++. In terms of databases, I have used MongoDB (NoSQL), Neo4J (Graph) and PostgreSQL (Relational) in the past.

Ideally, I would love to work as a back-end developer; however, I am definitely open to chatting about other types of opportunities.
